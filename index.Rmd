## Research Interests

My principal research interests lie in the field of Psycholinguistics, including language learning, reading and communication. I would like to commit myself to the research of language-based learning disabilities, such as dyslexia, in order to develop reliable diagnostic tools for early detection of reading impairments and contribute to the establishment of effective interventions to achieve the best possible outcomes for school age dyslexic children.
